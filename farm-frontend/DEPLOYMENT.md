# üöÄ Farm 3.0 Frontend Deployment Guide

## üìã Pre-deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup
1. **Node.js Requirements**
   - Node.js 18+ installed
   - npm or yarn package manager
   - Git for version control

2. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Copy and configure environment variables
   cp .env.example .env.local

   # Edit .env.local with your values:
   # - VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID (get from walletconnect.com)
   # - Contract addresses (already configured for Monad testnet)
   ```

3. **Dependencies Installation**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## üîß Development Deployment

### Local Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Access at: `http://localhost:3000`

### Development Build Testing
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
# or
yarn build
yarn preview
```

## üåê Production Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Setup Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Farm 3.0 frontend"
   git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Auto-deploy on every push to main branch

3. **Environment Variables in Vercel**
   ```
   VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_APP_NAME=Farm 3.0
   VITE_APP_DESCRIPTION=Blockchain Farming Game on Monad
   ```

### Option 2: Netlify

1. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Upload `dist` folder to Netlify
   - Or connect GitHub repository
   - Configure redirects: `/*    /index.html   200`

3. **Netlify Configuration** (`netlify.toml`)
   ```toml
   [build]
     publish = "dist"
     command = "npm run build"

   [[redirects]]
     from = "/*"
     to = "/index.html"
     status = 200
   ```

### Option 3: Traditional Hosting

1. **Build Production Files**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy Static Files**
   - Upload contents of `dist/` folder to your web server
   - Ensure proper routing configuration for SPA
   - Configure HTTPS (required for Web3 features)

## üîí Security Considerations

### Web3 Security
- Never expose private keys in frontend code
- Validate all user inputs before blockchain transactions
- Implement proper error handling for failed transactions
- Use HTTPS in production (required for wallet connections)

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Rotate WalletConnect project IDs regularly

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Bundle Optimization
- Code splitting is already configured in `vite.config.ts`
- Vendor chunks separated for better caching
- Tree shaking enabled for unused code removal

### Asset Optimization
- Images optimized for web delivery
- SVG icons used for scalability
- Minimal external dependencies

### Caching Strategy
- Static assets cached with long-term headers
- API responses cached appropriately
- Service worker for offline functionality (future enhancement)

## üîç Monitoring and Analytics

### Error Tracking (Optional)
```bash
npm install @sentry/react @sentry/tracing
```

### Web3 Metrics
- Track wallet connection rates
- Monitor transaction success/failure rates
- Analyze user engagement with game features

## üß™ Testing in Production

### Pre-launch Testing
1. **Wallet Integration**
   - Test MetaMask connection
   - Verify WalletConnect functionality
   - Test network switching to Monad testnet

2. **Smart Contract Interactions**
   - Test all contract function calls
   - Verify transaction confirmations
   - Test error handling for failed transactions

3. **UI/UX Testing**
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Loading states and error messages

### Launch Checklist
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] SSL certificate active (HTTPS)
- [ ] Wallet connections working
- [ ] Smart contract addresses correct
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Mobile optimization verified
- [ ] SEO meta tags configured

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Wallet Connection Fails**
   - Check HTTPS is enabled
   - Verify WalletConnect project ID
   - Ensure proper network configuration

2. **Contract Calls Fail**
   - Verify contract addresses are correct
   - Check user has sufficient gas/tokens
   - Confirm network is Monad testnet (Chain ID: 10143)

3. **Build Errors**
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall
   - Check Node.js version compatibility
   - Verify all environment variables are set

## üìà Post-deployment Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Update Web3 libraries for latest features
- Keep React and TypeScript versions current

### Performance Monitoring
- Track Core Web Vitals
- Monitor bundle size growth
- Analyze user interaction patterns

### Feature Rollouts
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
- A/B test new game mechanics
- Gather user feedback before major changes
